## Recommended Sports and Activities

---

Sports and physical activities are a great way to stay healthy and have fun. Here are four activities that I recommend trying:

| Sport/Activity  | Why I Recommend It                  | Hours/Week |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| Cycling         | Cycling is an excellent cardio workout, and it's a fun way to explore your surroundings. Whether you're commuting or hitting the trails, it's a great choice. | 5-7 hours  |
| Soccer          | Soccer is the world's most popular sport, known for its teamwork and endurance. It's easy to start playing with just a ball and a field. | 2-3 hours  |
| Swimming        | Swimming is a full-body workout that's easy on the joints. It's perfect for cooling off in the summer and improving endurance. | 4-6 hours  |
| Table Tennis       | Table tennis is a fast-paced indoor sport that improves reflexes and concentration. It's perfect for social gatherings. | 3-4 hours  |
